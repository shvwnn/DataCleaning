# DataCleaning
SQL datacleaning projects 
This repository contains SQL projects focused on real-world data cleaning. The datasets include messy business data with duplicates, null values, incorrect formats, and inconsistent records. 
Each project demonstrates how I use SQL to transform raw data into structured, accurate datasets ready for analysis and business insights.
